# PHP Board Generator

## Project Description

This project aims to create a PHP application that generates a board with dimensions defined by the user, filled with random values for terrain, energy, and lighting. The board is displayed as a table, and a summary of the number of cells with specific attribute values is also generated. The application allows users to input the number of columns and rows through an HTML form.

## Features

- Generates a board with dimensions specified by the user (x, y) within the range of 10 to 50.
- Randomly assigns terrain, energia, and lighting values to each cell on the board.
